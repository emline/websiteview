# README #

For the most part, this is the entire source code for the website. The website, a side project I started in 2011 and originally ran on Drupal, is basically a blog. However, because I'm not a fan of WordPress or an over-bloated CMS, I switched over to a simple PHP framework that closely had a workable MVC-like architecture. The main reason for using PHP Mini, rather than a robust framework like Codeigniter or Cake PHP is I want to build as much on my own. I want to learn and do everything on my own. I may be "re-inventing" the wheel on some things, but for the most part, this project's purpose is to learn.
